### New and noteworthy

#### Revamped Apex CPD

We are now using the Apex jorje lexer to tokenize Apex code for CPD. This change means:

    *   All comments are now ignored for CPD. This is consistent with how other languages such as Java and Groovy work.
    *   Tokenization honors the language specification, which improves accurancy.

CPD will therefore have less false positives and false negatives.

#### Removed Rules

*   The deprecated rule `UseSingleton` has been removed from the ruleset `java-design`. The rule has been renamed
    long time ago to `UseUtilityClass`.

### Fixed Issues

*   apex
    *   [#488](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/488): \[apex] Use Apex lexer for CPD

### API Changes

*   The class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.dfa.NodeType` has been converted to an enum.
    All node types are enum members now instead of int constants. The names for node types are retained.
