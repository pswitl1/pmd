### New and noteworthy

#### Revamped Apex CPD

We are now using the Apex Jorje Lexer to tokenize Apex code for CPD. This change means:

    *   All comments are now ignored for CPD. This is consistent with how other languages such as Java and Groovy work.
    *   Tokenization honors the language specification, which improves accuracy.

CPD will therefore have less false positives and false negatives.

#### Java Type Resolution

As part of Google Summer of Code 2017, [Bendegúz Nagy](https://github.com/WinterGrascph)'s work on type resolution for Java continues.
For this release he has extended support for method calls for both instance and static methods.

Method shadowing and overloading are supported, as are varargs. However, the selection of the target method upon the presence
of generics and type inference is still work in progress. Expect it in forecoming releases.

As for fields, the basic support was in place for release 5.8.0, but has now been expanded to support static fields.

#### Metrics Framework

As part of Google Summer of Code 2017, [Clément Fournier](https://github.com/oowekyala) is continuing his work
on the new metrics framework for object-oriented metrics.

There are already a couple of metrics (e.g. ATFD, WMC, Cyclo, LoC) implemented. More metrics are planned.
Based on those metrics, rules like "GodClass" detection can be implemented more easily.


#### Modified Rules

*   The rule `UnnecessaryFinalModifier` (ruleset `java-unnecessarycode`) has been revamped to detect more cases.
    It will now flag anonymous class' methods marked as final (can't be overridden, so it's pointless), along with
    final methods overridden / defined within enum instances.

#### Removed Rules

*   The deprecated rule `UseSingleton` has been removed from the ruleset `java-design`. The rule has been renamed
    long time ago to `UseUtilityClass`.

### Fixed Issues

*   apex

### API Changes

*   The class `net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.dfa.NodeType` has been converted to an enum.
    All node types are enum members now instead of int constants. The names for node types are retained.

*   The properties API (rule and report properties) have been revamped to be fully typesafe. This is everything
    around `net.sourceforge.pmd.PropertyDescriptor`.
