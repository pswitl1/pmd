### New and noteworthy

#### Tree transversal revision

As described in [#904](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/904), when searching for child nodes of the AST methods
such as `hasDescendantOfType`, `getFirstDescendantOfType` and `findDescendantsOfType` were found to behave inconsistently,
not all of them honoring find boundaries; that is, nodes that define a self-contained entity which should be considered separately
(think of lambdas, nested classes, anonymous classes, etc.). We have modified these methods to ensure all of them honor
find boundaries.

This change implies several false positives / unexpected results (ie: `ASTBlockStatement` falsely returning `true` to `isAllocation()`)
have been fixed; and lots of searches are now restricted to smaller search areas, which improves performance (depending on the project,
we have measured up to 10% improvements during Type Resolution, Symbol Table analysis, and some rule's application).

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule `UnnecessaryConstructor` (`java-codestyle`) has been rewritten as a Java rule (previously it was
    a XPath-based rule). It supports a new property `ignoredAnnotations` and ignores by default empty constructors,
    that are annotated with `javax.inject.Inject`. Additionally, it detects now also unnecessary private constructors
    in enums.

*   java-bestpractices
    *   [#370](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/370): \[java] GuardLogStatementJavaUtil not considering lambdas
    *   [#719](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/719): \[java] Unused Code: Java 8 receiver parameter with an internal class
*   java-codestyle
    *   [#1003](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1003): \[java] UnnecessaryConstructor triggered on required empty constructor (Dagger @Inject)
