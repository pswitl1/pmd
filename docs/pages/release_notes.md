### New and noteworthy

#### Kotlin support for CPD

Thanks to [Maikel Steneker](https://github.com/maikelsteneker), CPD now supports [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
This means, you can use CPD to find duplicated code in your Kotlin projects.

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/codestyle/UseUnderscoresInNumericLiterals" %} (`java-codestyle`)
    verifies that numeric literals over a given length (4 chars by default, but configurable) are using
    underscores every 3 digits for readability. The rule only applies to Java 7+ codebases.

### Fixed Issues

*   all
