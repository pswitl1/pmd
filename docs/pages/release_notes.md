### New and noteworthy

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/bestpractices/ForLoopVariableCount" %} (`java-bestpractices`) checks for
    the number of control variables in a for-loop. Having a lot of control variables makes it harder to understand
    what the loop does. The maximum allowed number of variables is by default 1 and can be configured by a
    property.

### Fixed Issues

*   java-bestpractices
    *   [#1519](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1519): \[java] New rule: ForLoopVariableCount
