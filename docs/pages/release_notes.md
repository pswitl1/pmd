### API Changes

#### Changes to the Node interface

The method `getXPathNodeName` is added to the `Node` interface, which removes the
use of the `toString` of a node to get its XPath element name (see [#569](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/569)).
A default implementation is provided in `AbstractNode`, to stay compatible
with existing implementors.

The `toString` method of a Node is not changed for the time being, and still produces
the name of the XPath node. That behaviour may however change in future major releases,
e.g. to produce a more useful message for debugging.
