### New and noteworthy

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/codestyle/UseUnderscoresInNumericLiterals" %} (`java-codestyle`)
    verifies that numeric literals over a given length (4 chars by default, but configurable) are using
    underscores every 3 digits for readability. The rule only applies to Java 7+ codebases.
