### New and noteworthy

### CPD Suppression for Antlr-based languages

[ITBA](https://www.itba.edu.ar/) students [Mat√≠as Fraga](https://github.com/matifraga),
[Tomi De Lucca](https://github.com/tomidelucca) and [Lucas Soncini](https://github.com/lsoncini)
keep working on bringing full Antlr support to PMD. For this release, they have implemented
token filtering in an equivalent way as we did for JavaCC languages, adding support for CPD
suppressions through `CPD-OFF` and `CPD-ON` comments for all Antlr-based languages.

This means, you can now ignore arbitrary blocks of code on:
* Go
* Kotlin
* Swift

Simply start the suppression with any comment (single or multiline) containing `CPD-OFF`,
and resume again with a comment containing `CPD-ON`.

More information is available in [the user documentation](pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#suppression).

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/bestpractices/UseTryWithResources" %) (`java-bestpractices`) searches
    for try-blocks, that could be changed to a try-with-resources statement. This statement ensures that
    each resource is closed at the end of the statement and is available since Java 7.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Apex rule {% rule "apex/codestyle/MethodNamingConventions" %} (apex-codestyle) has a new
    property `skipTestMethodUnderscores`, which is by default disabled. The new property allows for ignoring
    all test methods, either using the `testMethod` modifier or simply annotating them `@isTest`.
