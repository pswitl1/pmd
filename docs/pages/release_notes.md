### New and noteworthy

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/design/AvoidUncheckedExceptionsInSignatures" %} (`java-design`) finds methods or constructors
    that declare unchecked exceptions in their `throws` clause. This forces the caller to handle the exception,
    even though it is a runtime exception.

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/errorprone/DetachedTestCase" %} (`java-errorprone`) searches for public
    methods in test classes, which are not annotated with `@Test`. These methods might be test cases where
    the annotation has been forgotten. Because of that those test cases are never executed.
