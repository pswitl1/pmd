### New and noteworthy

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [JUnit4TestShouldUseTestAnnotation](pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#junit4testshouldusetestannotation) (`java-bestpractices`)
    has a new parameter "testClassPattern". It is used to distinguish test classes from other classes and
    avoid false positives. By default, any class, that has "Test" in its name, is considered a test class.

### API Changes

* The following classes in package `net.sourceforge.pmd.benchmark` have been deprecated: `Benchmark`, `Benchmarker`,
  `BenchmarkReport`, `BenchmarkResult`, `RuleDuration`, `StringBuilderCR` and `TextReport`. Their API is not supported anymore
  and is disconnected from the internals of PMD. Use the newer API based around `TimeTracker` instead, which can be found
  in the same package.
