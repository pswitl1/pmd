### New and noteworthy

#### New Rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/multithreading/UnsynchronizedStaticFormatter" %} (`java-multithreading`) detects
    unsynchronized usages of static `java.text.Format` instances. This rule is a more generic replacement of the
    rule {% rule "java/multithreading/UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter" %} which focused just on DateFormat.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/codestyle/LocalVariableCouldBeFinal" %} (`java-codestyle`) has a new
    property `ignoreForEachDecl`, which is by default disabled. The new property allows for ignoring
    non-final loop variables in a for-each statement.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/multithreading/UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter" %} has been deprecated and
    will be removed with PMD 7.0.0. The rule is replaced by the more general
    {% rule "java/multithreading/UnsynchronizedStaticFormatter" %}.
