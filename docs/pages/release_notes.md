### New and noteworthy

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule {% rule "java/codestyle/UseDiamondOperator" %} (`java-codestyle`) looks for constructor
    calls with explicit type parameters. Since Java 1.7, these type parameters are not necessary anymore, as they
    can be inferred now.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/codestyle/LocalVariableCouldBeFinal" %} (`java-codestyle`) has a new
    property `ignoreForEachDecl`, which is by default disabled. The new property allows for ignoring
    non-final loop variables in a for-each statement.

### Fixed Issues
