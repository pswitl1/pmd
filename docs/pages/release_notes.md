### API Changes

#### Changes to the Node interface

The method `getXPathNodeName` is added to the `Node` interface, which removes the
use of the `toString` of a node to get its XPath element name (see [#569](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/569)).
A default implementation is provided in `AbstractNode`, to stay compatible
with existing implementors.

The `toString` method of a Node is not changed for the time being, and still produces
the name of the XPath node. That behaviour may however change in future major releases,
e.g. to produce a more useful message for debugging.

#### Changes to CPD renderers

The interface `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Renderer` has been deprecated. A new interface `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.renderer.CPDRenderer`
has been introduced to replace it. The main difference is that the new interface is meant to render directly to a `java.io.Writer`
rather than to a String. This allows to greatly reduce the memory footprint of CPD, as on large projects, with many duplications,
it was causing `OutOfMemoryError`s (see [#795](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/795)).

`net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.FileReporter` has also been deprecated as part of this change, as it's no longer needed.
