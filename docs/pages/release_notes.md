### New and noteworthy

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`LinguisticNaming`](pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#linguisticnaming) (`java-codestyle`)
    detects cases, when a method name indicates it returns a boolean (such as `isSmall()`) but it doesn't.
    Besides method names, the rule also checks field and variable names. It also checks, that getters return
    something but setters won't. The rule has several properties with which it can be customized.

*   The new PL/SQL rule [`ForLoopNaming`](pmd_rules_plsql_codestyle.html#forloopnaming) (`plsql-codestyle`)
    enforces a naming convention for "for loops". Both "cursor for loops" and "index for loops" are covered.
    The rule can be customized via patterns. By default, short variable names are reported.
