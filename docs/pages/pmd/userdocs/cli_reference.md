        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>


## Exit Status

Please note that if PMD detects any violations, it will exit with status 4 (since 5.3).
This behavior has been introduced to ease PMD integration into scripts or hooks, such as SVN hooks.

<table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Everything is fine, no violations found</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Couldn't understand command line parameters or PMD exited with an exception</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At least one violation has been detected, unless '-failOnViolation false' is set.</td></tr>
</table>

## Incremental Analysis

Ever since PMD 5.6.0, PMD has been able to perform Incremental Analysis.

When performing Incremental Analysis for the first time, PMD will cache analysis data and results.
This allows subsequent analysis to only look into those files that are new / have changed. For
a typical development environment, where you are only changing a few files at a time, this can
reduce analysis time dramatically.

The generated report will be *exactly the same* as it would if running without incremental analysis.
Files included in the final report will reflect exactly those files in your filesystem. Even if
untouched, files with violations will be listed with full detail.


### Enabling Incremental Analysis

Incremental analysis is enabled automatically once a location to store the cache has been defined.
From Command Line that is done through the `-cache` argument, but support for the feature is
available for tools integrating PMD such as [Ant](pmd_userdocs_tools_ant.html),
[Maven](pmd_userdocs_tools_maven.html), and Gradle.
