## CouplingBetweenObjects

**Since:** PMD 1.04

**Priority:** Medium (3)

This rule counts the number of unique attributes, local variables, and return types within an object. 
A number higher than the specified threshold can indicate a high degree of coupling.

**This rule is defined by the following Java class:** [net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.coupling.CouplingBetweenObjectsRule](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-java/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/coupling/CouplingBetweenObjectsRule.java)

**Example(s):**

``` java
import com.Blah;
import org.Bar;
import org.Bardo;

public class Foo {
    private Blah var1;
    private Bar var2;

    //followed by many imports of unique objects
    void ObjectC doWork() {
        Bardo var55;
        ObjectA var44;
        ObjectZ var93;
        return something;
    }
}
```

**This rule has the following properties:**

|Name|Default Value|Description|
|----|-------------|-----------|
|threshold|20|Unique type reporting threshold|

## ExcessiveImports

**Since:** PMD 1.04

**Priority:** Medium (3)

A high number of imports can indicate a high degree of coupling within an object. This rule 
counts the number of unique imports and reports a violation if the count is above the 
user-specified threshold.

**This rule is defined by the following Java class:** [net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.coupling.ExcessiveImportsRule](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-java/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/coupling/ExcessiveImportsRule.java)

**Example(s):**

``` java
import blah.blah.Baz;
import blah.blah.Bif;
// 18 others from the same package elided
public class Foo {
    public void doWork() {}
}
```

**This rule has the following properties:**

|Name|Default Value|Description|
|----|-------------|-----------|
|topscore||Top score value|
|minimum||Minimum reporting threshold|
|sigma||Sigma value|

## LawOfDemeter

**Since:** PMD 5.0

**Priority:** Medium (3)

The Law of Demeter is a simple rule, that says "only talk to friends". It helps to reduce coupling between classes
or objects.

**This rule is defined by the following Java class:** [net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.coupling.LawOfDemeterRule](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-java/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/coupling/LawOfDemeterRule.java)

**Example(s):**

``` java
public class Foo {
    /**
     * This example will result in two violations.
     */
    public void example(Bar b) {
        // this method call is ok, as b is a parameter of "example"
        C c = b.getC();

        // this method call is a violation, as we are using c, which we got from B.
        // We should ask b directly instead, e.g. "b.doItOnC();"
        c.doIt();

        // this is also a violation, just expressed differently as a method chain without temporary variables.
        b.getC().doIt();

        // a constructor call, not a method call.
        D d = new D();
        // this method call is ok, because we have create the new instance of D locally.
        d.doSomethingElse(); 
    }
}
```

## LooseCoupling

**Since:** PMD 0.7

**Priority:** Medium (3)

The use of implementation types as object references limits your ability to use alternate
implementations in the future as requirements change. Whenever available, referencing objects 
by their interface types provides much more flexibility.

**This rule is defined by the following Java class:** [net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.coupling.LooseCouplingRule](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-java/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/coupling/LooseCouplingRule.java)

**Example(s):**

``` java
// sub-optimal approach
private ArrayList<SomeType> list = new ArrayList<>();

public HashSet<SomeType> getFoo() {
    return new HashSet<SomeType>();
}

// preferred approach
private List<SomeType> list = new ArrayList<>();

public Set<SomeType> getFoo() {
    return new HashSet<SomeType>();
}
```

## LoosePackageCoupling

**Since:** PMD 5.0

**Priority:** Medium (3)

Avoid using classes from the configured package hierarchy outside of the package hierarchy, 
except when using one of the configured allowed classes.

**This rule is defined by the following Java class:** [net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.java.rule.coupling.LoosePackageCouplingRule](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/master/pmd-java/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/coupling/LoosePackageCouplingRule.java)

**Example(s):**

``` java
package some.package;

import some.other.package.subpackage.subsubpackage.DontUseThisClass;

public class Bar {
    DontUseThisClass boo = new DontUseThisClass();
}
```

**This rule has the following properties:**

|Name|Default Value|Description|
|----|-------------|-----------|
|classes|[]|Allowed classes|
|packages|[]|Restricted packages|
