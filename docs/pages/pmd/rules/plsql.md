List of rulesets and rules contained in each ruleset.

*   [Code Size](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html): The Code Size ruleset contains rules that find problems related to code size or complexity.
*   [PLSQL DATETIME](pmd_rules_plsql_dates.html): The Dates ruleset deals with PLSQL DATETIME usages.
*   [Strict Syntax](pmd_rules_plsql_strictsyntax.html): The Strict Syntax ruleset contains rules that highlight invalid plsql syntax, which works, but should be avoided.
*   [Tom Kyte's Despair](pmd_rules_plsql_TomKytesDespair.html): Rules based on Thomas Kyte's recommendations on http://asktom.oracle.com/ and http://tkyte.blogspot.com/.

## Code Size
*   [CyclomaticComplexity](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#cyclomaticcomplexity): Complexity directly affects maintenance costs is determined by the number of decision points in a...
*   [ExcessiveMethodLength](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#excessivemethodlength): When methods are excessively long this usually indicates that the method is doing more than itsna...
*   [ExcessiveObjectLength](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#excessiveobjectlength): Excessive object line lengths are usually indications that the object may be burdened with excess...
*   [ExcessivePackageBodyLength](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#excessivepackagebodylength): Excessive class file lengths are usually indications that the class may be burdened with excessiv...
*   [ExcessivePackageSpecificationLength](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#excessivepackagespecificationlength): Excessive class file lengths are usually indications that the class may be burdened with excessiv...
*   [ExcessiveParameterList](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#excessiveparameterlist): Methods with numerous parameters are a challenge to maintain, especially if most of them share th...
*   [ExcessiveTypeLength](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#excessivetypelength): Excessive class file lengths are usually indications that the class may be burdened with excessiv...
*   [NcssMethodCount](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#ncssmethodcount): This rule uses the NCSS (Non-Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of l...
*   [NcssObjectCount](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#ncssobjectcount): This rule uses the NCSS (Non-Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of l...
*   [NPathComplexity](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#npathcomplexity): The NPath complexity of a method is the number of acyclic execution paths through that method.A t...
*   [TooManyFields](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#toomanyfields): Classes that have too many fields can become unwieldy and could be redesigned to have fewer field...
*   [TooManyMethods](pmd_rules_plsql_codesize.html#toomanymethods): A package or type with too many methods is probably a good suspect for refactoring, in order to r...

## PLSQL DATETIME
*   [TO_DATE_TO_CHAR](pmd_rules_plsql_dates.html#to_date_to_char): TO_DATE(TO_CHAR(date-variable)) used to remove time component - use TRUNC(date-veriable)
*   [TO_DATEWithoutDateFormat](pmd_rules_plsql_dates.html#to_datewithoutdateformat): TO_DATE without date format- use TO_DATE(expression, date-format)
*   [TO_TIMESTAMPWithoutDateFormat](pmd_rules_plsql_dates.html#to_timestampwithoutdateformat): TO_TIMESTAMP without date format- use TO_TIMESTAMP(expression, date-format)

## Strict Syntax
*   [MisplacedPragma](pmd_rules_plsql_strictsyntax.html#misplacedpragma): Oracle states that the PRAQMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION must be in the declaration block,but the cod...

## Tom Kyte's Despair
*   [TomKytesDespair](pmd_rules_plsql_TomKytesDespair.html#tomkytesdespair): "WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL" hides all errors - (Re)RAISE an exception or call RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR
