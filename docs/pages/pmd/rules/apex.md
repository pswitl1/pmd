## Best Practices
*   [ApexUnitTestClassShouldHaveAsserts](pmd_rules_apex_bestpractices.html#apexunittestclassshouldhaveasserts): Apex unit tests should include at least one assertion.  This makes the tests more robust, and usi...

*   [AvoidLogicInTrigger](pmd_rules_apex_bestpractices.html#avoidlogicintrigger): As triggers do not allow methods like regular classes they are less flexible and suited to apply ...

## Codestyle
*   [ClassNamingConventions](pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#classnamingconventions): Class names should always begin with an upper case character.

*   [WhileLoopsMustUseBraces](pmd_rules_apex_codestyle.html#whileloopsmustusebraces): Avoid using 'while' statements without using braces to surround the code block. If the codeformat...

## Design
*   [AvoidDeeplyNestedIfStmts](pmd_rules_apex_design.html#avoiddeeplynestedifstmts): Avoid creating deeply nested if-then statements since they are harder to read and error-prone to ...
*   [CyclomaticComplexity](pmd_rules_apex_design.html#cyclomaticcomplexity): The complexity of methods directly affects maintenance costs and readability. Concentrating too m...

*   [StdCyclomaticComplexity](pmd_rules_apex_design.html#stdcyclomaticcomplexity): Complexity directly affects maintenance costs is determined by the number of decision points in a...
*   [TooManyFields](pmd_rules_apex_design.html#toomanyfields): Classes that have too many fields can become unwieldy and could be redesigned to have fewer field...

## Error Prone
*   [AvoidDirectAccessTriggerMap](pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#avoiddirectaccesstriggermap): Avoid directly accessing Trigger.old and Trigger.new as it can lead to a bug. Triggers should be ...

*   [EmptyCatchBlock](pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#emptycatchblock): Empty Catch Block finds instances where an exception is caught, but nothing is done.  In most cir...

*   [EmptyStatementBlock](pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#emptystatementblock): Empty block statements serve no purpose and should be removed.

*   [MethodWithSameNameAsEnclosingClass](pmd_rules_apex_errorprone.html#methodwithsamenameasenclosingclass): Non-constructor methods should not have the same name as the enclosing class.

## Performance
*   [AvoidDmlStatementsInLoops](pmd_rules_apex_performance.html#avoiddmlstatementsinloops): Avoid DML statements inside loops to avoid hitting the DML governor limit. Instead, try to batch ...
