title:  Using code metrics in custom rules
tags: [customizing]
summary: "PMD was recently enhanced with the ability to compute code metrics on Java and Apex source (the so-called 
Metrics Framework). This framework provides developers with a straightforward interface to use code metrics in their 
rules, and to extend the framework with their own custom metrics."

# Using code metrics in custom rules

## Using the metrics framework

{%include note.html content="Using the metrics framework is for now restricted to Java rules (with plans to support 
XPath rules later)." %}

To use the metrics framework in a custom rule, the first thing to do would be to enable metrics by adding the 
`metrics="true"` attribute to your rule's XML element.

{%include note.html content="The following explains how to use the Java metrics framework. The Apex framework 
differs only by the name of its classes." %}

In PMD's Metrics framework, a metric is an operation that can be carried out on nodes of a certain type and produces 
a numeric result. In the Java framework, metrics can be computed on operation declaration nodes (constructor and 
method declaration), and type declaration nodes (class, interface, enum, and annotation declarations). A metric 
object in the framework can only handle either types or operations, but not both.

The framework provides a library of already implemented metrics. These metrics are referenced by `MetricKey` objects,
which are listed in two public enums: `JavaClassMetricKey` and `JavaOperationMetricKey`. Metric keys wrap a metric, and
know which type of node their metric can be computed on. That way, you cannot compute an operation metric on a class 
declaration node. Metrics that can be computed on operation and type declarations (e.g. NCSS) have one metric key in 
each enum.
 
The static faÃ§ade class `JavaMetrics` is the single entry point to compute metrics in the Java framework. 
This class provides the method `get` and its overloads. The following sections describes the interface of this class.

### Basic usage

The simplest overloads of `JavaMetrics.get` take two parameters: **a `MetricKey` and a node of the corresponding type.** 
Say you want to write a rule to report methods that have a high cyclomatic complexity. In your rule's visitor, you 
can get the value of Cyclo for a method node like so:
```java
public Object visit(ASTMethodDeclaration method, Object data) {
  int cyclo = (int) JavaMetrics.get(JavaOperationMetricKey.CYCLO, method);
  if (cyclo > 10) {
    // add violation
  }
  return data;
}
```

The same goes for class metrics: you select one among `JavaClassMetricKey`'s constants and pass it along with the node
 to `JavaMetrics.get`.
 
 {%include tip.html content="A new visitor adapter (`JavaParserVisitorReducedAdapter`) exists to e.g. check 
 constructors and method nodes completely alike. This comes in handy for metrics, as they usually don't make the distinction" %}
 
### Capability checking

Metrics are not necessarily computable on any node of the type they handle. For example, Cyclo cannot be computed on 
abstract methods. Metric keys provides a `supports(Node)` boolean method to find out if the metric can be computed on
the specified node. **If the metric cannot be computed on the given node, `JavaMetrics.get` will return `Double.NaN` .** 
If you're concerned about that, you can condition your call on whether the node is supported or not:
```java
public Object visit(ASTMethodDeclaration method, Object data) {
  if (JavaOperationMetricKey.CYCLO.supports(node)) {
    int cyclo = (int) JavaMetrics.get(JavaOperationMetricKey.CYCLO, method);
    if (cyclo > 10) {
      // add violation
    }
    return data;
  }
}
```

### Metric options

Some metrics define options that can be used to slightly modify the computation. You'll typically see these options 
gathered inside an enum in the implementation class of the metric, for example `CycloMetric.CycloOptions`. They're 
also documented on the [index of metrics](pmd_java_metrics_index.html).

To use options with a metric, you must first bundle them into a `MetricOptions` object. `MetricOptions` provides the 
utility method `ofOptions` to get a `MetricOptions` bundle from a collection or with varargs parameters. You can then 
pass this bundle as a parameter to `JavaMetrics.get`:
```java
public Object visit(ASTMethodDeclaration method, Object data) {
  int cyclo = (int) JavaMetrics.get(JavaOperationMetricKey.CYCLO, method, 
                                    MetricOptions.ofOptions(CycloOptions.IGNORE_BOOLEAN_PATHS));
  if (cyclo > 10) {
      // add violation
  }
    return data;
}
```

The version of `MetricOptions.ofOptions` using a collection is useful when you're building a `MetricOptions` from eg 
the value of an `EnumeratedMultiProperty`, which gives users control of the options they use. See 
[CyclomaticComplexityRule](to_be_moved) for an example usage.

### Result options

The Metrics API also gives you the possibility to aggregate the result of an operation metric on all operations of a 
class very simply. You can for example get the highest value of the metric over a class that way:
```java
public Object visit(ASTClassOrInterfaceDeclaration clazz, Object data) {
  int highest = (int) JavaMetrics.get(JavaOperationMetricKey.CYCLO, clazz, 
                                      ResultOption.HIGHEST);
  if (highest > 10) {
      // add violation
  }
    return data;
}
```

Notice that **we use an operation metric and a class node**. The `ResultOption` parameter controls what result will be 
computed: you can choose among `HIGHEST`, `SUM` and `AVERAGE`. You can use metric options together with a result 
option too.
