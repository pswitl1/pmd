## Contributing via pull requests

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

*   Please create your pull request against the `master` branch. We will rebase/merge it to the maintenance
    branches, if necessary. Just fork the [pmd repo](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/) and
    create a [pull request](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pulls).

*   We are using [checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/) to enforce a common code style.
    The check is integrated into the default build - so, make sure, you can [build PMD](pmd_devdocs_building.html)
    without errors.

    The following section goes into more details about our Checkstyle configuration.
