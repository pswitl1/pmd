# How it works

PMD checks source code against rules and produces a report. Like this:

*   Something passes a file name and a RuleSet into PMD.
*   PMD hands an InputStream of the source file to a JavaCC-generated parser.
*   PMD gets a reference to an Abstract Syntax Tree back from the parser.
*   PMD hands the AST off to the symbol table layer which builds scopes, finds declarations, and find usages.
*   If any rules need data flow analysis, PMD hands the AST over to the DFA layer for building control flow graphs and data flow nodes.
*   Each Rule in the RuleSet gets to traverse the AST and check for problems. The rules can also poke around the symbol table and DFA nodes.
*   The Report is now filled with RuleViolations, and those get printed out in XML or HTML or whatever.

Not much detail hereâ€¦ if you think this document can be improved, please post [here](http://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/discussion/188192) and let us know how. Thanks!
