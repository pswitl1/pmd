/**
 * Object storing the statistics and memoizers of the analysed project, like PackageStats for Java. These are the entry
 * point for signature matching requests. If retrieving eg an operation stats is expensive, consider implementing a
 * cache.
 *
 * <p>Language specific implementations should implement some signature matching utilities for metrics to use. The
 * details of how the mirror and its subcomponents are built must be kept out of the interfaces and visible only to the
 * language specific metric package. Metric implementations, even standard ones, should not have access to it.
 *
 * <p>While classes and operations are widespread and vary little in form across (class based at least) object-oriented
 * languages, the structure of a project is very language specific. For example, while an intuitive way to represent a
 * Java project is with a package tree, Apex has no package system. We consider here that there's no point providing
 * base implementations, so we use an interface. You could even implement it with a bunch of maps, which may yield good
 * results! // TODO:cf investigate that
