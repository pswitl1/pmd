/**
 * McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity. Number of independent paths through a block of code [1, 2]. Formally, given that the
 * control flow graph of the block has n vertices, e edges and p connected components, the Cyclomatic complexity of the
 * block is given by {@code CYCLO = e - n + 2p} [2]. In practice it can be calculated by counting control flow
 * statements following the standard rules given below.
 *
 * <p>The standard version of the metric complies with McCabe's original definition:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>+1 for every control flow statement ({@code if, case, catch, finally, do, while, for, break, continue}) and
 * conditional expression ({@code ? : }). Notice switch cases count as one, but not the switch itself: the point is
 * that a switch should have the same complexity value as the equivalent series of {@code if} statements.
 * <li>{@code else} and {@code default} don't count;
 * <li>+1 for every boolean operator in the guard condition of a control flow statement. That's because Java has
 * short-circuit evaluation semantics for boolean operators, which makes every boolean operator kind of a control flow
 * statement in itself.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Version {@link Version#IGNORE_BOOLEAN_PATHS}: Boolean operators are not counted, which means that empty
 * fall-through cases in {@code switch} statements are not counted as well.
