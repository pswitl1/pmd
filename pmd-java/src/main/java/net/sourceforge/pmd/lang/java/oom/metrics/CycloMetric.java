/**
 * McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity. Number of independent paths through a block of code. Formally, given that the control
 * flow graph of a method has n edges, m nodes and p connected components, the Cyclomatic complexity of the method is
 * given by CYCLO = n - m + 2p. In practice it can be calculated by counting control flow statements following the
 * standard rules given below.
 *
 * <p>The standard version of the metric complies with McCabe's original definition:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>+1 for every control flow statement ({@code if, case, catch, finally, do, while, for, break, continue}) and
 * conditional expression ({@code ? : }). Notice switch cases count as one, but not the switch itself: the point is
 * that a switch should have the same complexity value as the equivalent series of {@code if} statements.
 * <li>{@code else} and {@code default} don't count;
 * <li>+1 for every boolean operator in the guard condition of a control flow statement. That's because Java has
 * short-circuit evaluation semantics for boolean operators, which makes every boolean operator kind of a control flow
 * statement in itself.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> Version {@link Version#DO_NOT_COUNT_EXPRESSION_PATHS}: Boolean operators are not counted, which means that empty
 * fall-through cases in {@code switch} statements are not counted as well.
