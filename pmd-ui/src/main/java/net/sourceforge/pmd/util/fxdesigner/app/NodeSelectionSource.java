 * A control or controller that somehow displays nodes in a form that the user can select.

 * the TreeView, the editor, etc. To achieve that uniformly, node selection events are merged
 * into a global stream for the whole app. Events from that stream are handled by {@link MainDesignerController}.
 *
 * <p>Node selection sources form a tree parallel to {@link AbstractController} and {@link SettingsOwner}.
 * This interface implements behaviour for leaves of the tree. Inner nodes are handled by
 * {@link CompositeSelectionSource}.
